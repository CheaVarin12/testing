1. Please set each field's data type and length in all the above tablesâ€™ fields.

CREATE TABLE staffs (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    sex ENUM('M', 'F') NOT NULL,
    date_of_birth DATE NOT NULL,
    address TEXT NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL UNIQUE
);

CREATE TABLE positions (
    id BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    staff_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    position VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    end_date DATE NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (staff_id) REFERENCES staffs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

2. Write a raw query to select data for the following list.

| Staff ID | Name | Sex | Date of Birth | Address | Phone | Current Position |


SELECT 
    s.id AS `Staff ID`,
    s.name AS `Name`,
    s.sex AS `Sex`,
    s.date_of_birth AS `Date of Birth`,
    s.address AS `Address`,
    s.phone AS `Phone`,
    p.position AS `Current Position`
FROM staffs s
LEFT JOIN positions p ON s.id = p.staff_id
WHERE p.end_date IS NULL;

3. Write a raw query to select staff who have worked more than 5 years.

| Staff ID | Name | Sex | Date of Birth | Address | Phone | Current Position |

SELECT 
    s.id AS `Staff ID`,
    s.name AS `Name`,
    s.sex AS `Sex`,
    s.date_of_birth AS `Date of Birth`,
    s.address AS `Address`,
    s.phone AS `Phone`,
    p.position AS `Current Position`
FROM staffs s
JOIN positions p ON s.id = p.staff_id
WHERE DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), p.start_date) / 365 > 5
AND p.end_date IS NULL;
